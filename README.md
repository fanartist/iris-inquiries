# senior-year
summary of my senior year, for my family

This is the project I decided to start on for my parents and little brother.
I will be sgoing to college in a few months, and since I'm not too good at always communicating my thoughts and feelings towards my family, I decided to make them a website with little blog posts. 

I will continue to add onto this website, where all my entries are compiled, even after I go to college. Hopefully this will become a tangible collection of truely "Iris" experiences
