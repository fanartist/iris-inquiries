On the 24th, UF decisions came out! It would be mean to say that I thought I wouldn't be able to get in, I knew that my "stats", as students call it, were on the upper end of the usual UF incoming class. However, that doesn't deduct from the intense joy I felt, seeing the acceptance letter (shown below)

I did feel a little apprehensive about the chances of my admission into their honors college, just because it's hard (in my eyes) to get into any honors college, really. I'm so grateful that I was blessed with not only an Honors acceptance, but also a scholarship and selection for the University Honors Research Program. 
And that joy was magnified tenfold when I saw my excitement reflected in your faces as well. Thank you both for being supportive of everything I did academically. I know we couldn't be too extensively involved, just because of covid, you both working, and the distance from the school; however, I could feel that you two really tried to be present and supportive throughout not only my highschool years, but my entire life. I am getting quite sad writing this, because I am thinking about how much I will miss your company when I head off to college. Again, thank you, I couldn't have recieved all these nice benefits from the University of Florida without your help.

Also, we went to get another laptop the day after that. It was a long struggle with the lenovo laptops, the 14 inch lenovo ideapad flex 5's all had a manufacturing defect with their wifi drivers, and the 15.6 inch one (that carried me through the entire YSP and college application and part of the scholarship process, not to mention HOURS and HOURS of coursework in school), had a faulty hinge that led to its eventual self-destruction six months after its purchase. The warranty didn't cover it, and me and dad couldn't see any immediate fix. 
Costco had a $150 off macbooks deal at this time, and I suggested maybe we can buy one. I'd like to apologize for this whole matter again. You can say it's not my fault, but it's my fault for not selecting a better made laptop right from the start. I'm sorry for all the hassle, time, and money spent on getting me a laptop. I cried mostly because of that feeling of guilt, not necessarily because the laptop broke.  I am also quite spoiled I think, a $1.1k laptop right after my previous one was just aesthetically harmed. It was still functional, granted, I couldn't take it anymore. Still, I am beyond grateful I was given a second chance at keeping a laptop for years to come. I will cherish this device, thank you.
