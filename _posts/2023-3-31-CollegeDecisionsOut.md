All of my college decisions have came out by today. I will briefly go over the results.

rejections:
all the ivies I applied to, so Yale, Harvard, Brown, Columbia, and Cornell, and WashU.

waitlists:
unc, john hopkins, uMichigan, Emory, Duke

acceptances:
UCF, UF, OSU, vanderbilt, northwestern, stanford!!!


I'd like to preface with saying that I am quite apologetic that I couldn't fulfill the "my daughter attends an ivy" ego boost that I really wanted to give to you guys. As immigrant parents who have worked so hard to give me a nice life, I realized too late that I wanted to fulfill that specific wish that I self-imposed on you guys. You both are extremely supportive of most everything I do in my life and have always been there to direct me on my path. I cannot express how much I appreciate you both. 

I was the most excited to recieve Stanford's acceptance, then UF, and then following that, Northwestern and Vanderbilt.

I am glad I was able to give you guys the experience of your daughter getting into a prestigious school, even if it wasn't an ivy league. But I think i'm more happy about getting into Stanford than some ivy leagues, such as dartmouth or cornell, just because Stanford has more stem opportunities and their premed track is supposedly better. and of course, I'm also realy grateful. I will make you guys proud.
