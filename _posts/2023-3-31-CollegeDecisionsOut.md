All of my college decisions have came out by today. I will briefly go over the results.

rejections:
all the ivies I applied to, so Yale, Harvard, Brown, Columbia, and Cornell, and WashU.

waitlists:
unc, john hopkins, uMichigan, Emory, Duke

acceptances:
UCF, UF, OSU, vanderbilt, northwestern, stanford!!!


I'd like to preface with saying that I am quite apologetic that I couldn't fulfill the "my daughter attends an ivy" ego boost that I really wanted to give to you guys. As immigrant parents who have worked so hard to give me a nice life, I realized too late that I wanted to fulfill that specific wish that I self-imposed on you guys. You both are extremely supportive of most everything I do in my life and have always been there to direct me on my path. I cannot express how much I appreciate you both. 

I was the most excited to recieve Stanford's acceptance, then UF, and then following that, Northwestern and Vanderbilt.

I am glad I was able to give you guys the experience of your daughter getting into a prestigious school.
