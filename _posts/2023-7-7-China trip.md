We went to see mom's second sister and a recent medical graduate from beijing university (PKU). We ate gong pao chicken, spicy fish, salads, five streak pork, and shan yao with rice. We drank this red bean and corn drink. It was very good, and I missed second sister. I'm glad I got to see her again, although I didn't have the chance to talk to her much because there was the graduate there sitting between me and her. He talked a lot, which is on one hand helpful, but on the other was obstructing me from talking about our family on my mom's side in beijing. It was apparent to me from this encounter that second sister is quite wealthy. 

We parted ways at about 2 pm, because we went to spend time at Wang Ning's apartment! We made fish and shrimp filling dumplings and ate them along with some other little dishes. They gave me 1000 yuan and leo gave me a jellycat dog. i like them so much.

i got to test out the wechat pay this afternoon at the mall near us. I bought one of those mystery boxes of the milk and mocha (cat version). it was 30 yuan but I got the white cat on a pink motorcycle. it's so cute. I also bought the uniqlo banana bag i've been wanting to buy. it was 99 yuan

we went to the great wall of china this morning! we got up at 5 am to drive an hour to the great wall and took the zipline car up to the wall, then we hiked the way down. it was very pretty, seeing the landscape of the snaking wall as it made its way through the mountains. In the zipline car we went up in, there was a mother and her little son with us. the zipline car sometimes lurched forward, which scared her, and she'd hang on to my arm.
at the great wall, we took lots of pictures. Dad would always tell us to go take pictures and auntie would be like "no, no". It was really funny.

uncle and auntie went back to the house in hepingli, the one that my dad and uncle grew up in with grandma and grandpa. they also went to get medicine for auntie's diabetes. uncle has some kidney problem. while they were doing that, we stayed back. we as in including ethan, dad, grandma, and i. our little family went to daoxiangcun to buy deserts. It was crazy seeing that shop again, the last time i went was back in 2013. we went a little overboard, we bought bunny cakes and green tea cakes and cake rolls (chocolate) and red bean cakes and date cakes and so much. dad also bought some cooked meat, like meatballs and chicken legs and sausages and such. the total came out to be about 400 yuan i think, or about 60 dollars USD. it always surprised me how 

7/13/2023
we went to the beijing zoo today! there were so many cool animals that we saw, including but not limited to, monkeys (chimpanzees), wolves, elephants, pandas, etc. 

7/14/2023
we went to visit grandpa's gravestone. when i was 7, he died of pancreatic cancer in 2013 and we flew to china to visit him and family before he passed. I was old enough to know 

7/15/2023
for lunch, we went to a restaurant with rooster decorations on the fine china. we ate a bunch of dishes again. we ate there with the person who came to pick us up from the airport. he is our uncle's friend from work (?) maozi. they spent the entire time talking about the politics between china and the united states, and also about black people because its a fun thing for them to talk about race. 
they also talked about how i'm a very good kid and voiced their concerns for ethan. uncle loves talking about how i would love to play as a kid and would jump on the bed while my grandpa gave me 
at about 3 pm we left the restaurant to go take the subway to wang ning's place. it went a lot better than i thought because the condition of beijing subways is much better than the stuff up in new york. it was a little confusing getting on the subway but otherwise it was smooth sailing, and wang ning picked us up at the stop close to their place. 
wu yue showed me an excerpt from her journal that she had published and she talked about me in it. she mostly talked about her visit to us in madison, wisconsin, and how she thought i was very mature.
we slept over at their house that night and i slept with wu yue lady.

7/19
in the morning we had the opening ceremony and met students at the nearby middle school. we exchanged wechats and i drew a dog picture for one of them! they gave me a boy drawing the day we met them again.

7/20
we went to practice mao bi hua this morning! i was with wang wang who taught me how to write stuff. she was super nice and super smart, she could answer all the questions that the teacher asked!
we wrote on fans and traded. we also cut paper. i cut a paper phoenix and glued it on the back of the fan i made for wang wang.
she is a CCP youth and flexed her badge to me. she told me about a bunch of tourist attractions but i wasn’t able to remember it all.

7/21
we walked so much this morning. We separated into five groups of four. in my group there was chloe my dorm mate, joyce, and tiffany. we went to many towers and did so many things. 我的腿很痛。走的太多了。a boy was sweating buckets and another boy (michael) almost got a heatstroke. we are delicious food again at lunch and in the afternoon we went to a boat museum and another history museum.
we ate dinner a little earlier today because we got back early. three of the main leaders weren’t with us for dinner, so i took a picture of the food instead

in the evening, we were supposed to play among us in racy’s room 702 but my stomach and head was hurting from the sundae that ryan and raymond’s mom got everyone. i stayed back and later chloe came back to check up on me. she is so sweet. when she came my headache stopped :) and me and chloe watched the emoji movie and started the live action beauty and the beast (but fell asleep midway through).

7/22
this morning the group leader with eyebrows asked me to do the closing ceremony speech. i hope i don’t have to do that. they gave us little snack packets for the first time and we rode the bus for about an hour to the incense place。we went in the museum and looked at how to make the incense.
we didn’t go back to the hotel for lunch; we went to a restaurant. then we drove an hour to a clay and a pottery museum. we also painted little figurines while we were there. i painted the little bear and lantern characters of the olympics in beijing. 
on the car ride back home we played games where the teacher would say either the right or left hand and then we’d have to lift the other hand up. losers would have to perform a song. 
in the evening we played among us and ordered takeout from mcdonald’s.

7/23
we drove over an hour to the tea place in anxi. we picked the oolong tea and went through all the processes of making the tea for us people to drink. this included rocking the dried tea leaves on a boat/ big plate, drying the leaves in the sun, stir frying(?) the leaves, and rolling it all into a ball. we also learned to pour tea and make tea correctly. a world class tea lady taught us and she was very nice. i bought some dragon (?) oolong tea to bring back for grandma and uncle and aunt to drink.
uncle and aunt were in quanzhou today and yesterday as part of their fujian excursion, so they came to see me today and gave me snacks. i told them about the camp so far and i gave them the tea.

7/24
we drove like 3 hours to the mud huts. we saw the tulou. it was very impressive and i have the pictures but the tour lady invited us to her tulou and gave us tea.
on the way back we stopped at a visitor center and i bought vegetable milk and it was really good.

7/25
today we hiked in the mountains in the morning. we saw the buddha statues and took pictures there. in the afternoon we went to two museums, for architecture and statues also.
in the evening the teachers took us out to the main (?) street and we went shopping!!!! this is what i bought for everyone. i also got a oolong milk tea boba and it was really yummy too.

7/26
we went to a statue park this morning and also went to the beach. there was a typhoon coming though so the wind would shoot up sand at our legs and it hurt a lot. we walked around and looked at statues and i bought a red bean popsicle. they watched the cultivation cdrama on the bus ride back and i slept. in the afternoon break me and chloe napped. i love how they bought us mcdonald’s for the dinner and the cake they made for us was really thoughtful because all our names are on it. They made the graduated seniors go up and cut the cake for everyone, our names were also on the top of the cake.

7/28
the flight was cancelled so i stayed in the hotel the entire day. We played with cards, poker (I suck at gambling), watched tv shows, and watched a Chinese movie about a murder mystery that came out recently. It described a man who is searching for his wife who disappeared one night when he was supposed to be with her at a night life party. He wakes up one morning with a stranger claiming to be his wife, and everything, such as photos and security cameras, all show her with him instead of her actual wife. The main guy bands with a lawyer and try to find evidence to prove that the stranger isn’t his wife, but they eventually get cornered and she says the only way to save it is by finding the deceased wife’s body. He tells her the location and its revealed that he was an ex gambler and his wife was rich, he only got with her because she was rich, and when she refused to pay off his gambling debt, he killed her. The lawyer is actually the wife’s only friend who put on this entire act with other people (including the stranger who the main guy woke up to) and she locked him up. A really sad part was when the wife was trapped in the cage the husband put her in, she was going to show him the picture of their child in her stomach but the guy swam away without knowing. The wife’s friend showed the guy (behind bars) the picture now and the movie ended with him screaming. It was really good actually. 
i found out that the older kids drank soju during camp one time, jake included. I said no when they asked me to drink.

7/29
Zheng teacher brought Jake, Michael, Jonathan, and me to the xiamen airport. Michael and Jonathan were picked up by their aunt at the airport and Zheng teacher put me and Jake through security after we retrieved our tickets. I gave the clay dog I made to the teacher and it looked like he was about to cry. Anyway, Jake and I wandered the streets of the airport and looked at all the various expensive stuff. i bought one refrigerator magnet for my mom. Jake and I split a combo meal at KFC. He let me have the breaded burger and even wanted to give me the chicken wings/legs :( he was fr a really nice and kind kid. But I was full so I let him have it. I ordered a grape juice and egg tarts (included in the meal) so it was really good. we went to the boarding gate when we were done and played “guess the song” on Spotify until I had to board. He waited with me the entire time and hugged me as I left. I flew back and watched big hero 6 the flight back and it passed really quick. I went through the Beijing airport and waited at the McDonalds (and bought an ice cream while I was at it, it was only 5 yuan I was like omg). I was so happy to see dada and dad. I’m finally back in Beijing!

7/31
I think I spent the entire day not doing much today. I took a three hour nap in the afternoon though and ate good food. It was very good. It’s raining a lot in Mentougou, so we went out to walk the streets in the afternoon. It was flooding in the rivers and mud was everywhere, we wadded through thick mud and it covered our lower leg. We had to wash it off in the rain puddles because the water stopped in our place in Mentougou. We ate ramen and I made the music box ferris wheel thing with grandma and uncle in the evening. Tomorrow we go to hepingli!!!

8/2
we went to a big mall to eat breakfast
i had a oral for the chinese placement exam at stanford. i would like to take chinese in my academic year because i want to be better at it. 

8/3
aunt took me to the biggest shopping center i’ve ever been to in my entire life. she told  me to pick earrings out and they were all so expensive!!!! I want to be able to accept expensive gifts but when i think about the price and then how much they earn, i couldn’t. the earrings were on average 3000 RMB which is like 400 usd. anyway, we also went to the other parts of the mall and looked at expensive jewelry, clothes, and shoes. and then we went to a second mall that was connected to the first mall at the second floor. we went to a shop like miniso but bigger with a lot more things! and i bought a bunch of little stuff and a hulu phone case. then we went back to the first  mall and aunt practically pressured me into picking an earring out. in the end, i got these flower thread 18k solid rose gold earrings which were originally 806 RMB (something i was okay with). i was really satisfied with it. It’s really pretty and I feel like a girl!

8/4
dad and i went to tianjin. we saw his friend who works at a chicken laboratory and we ate lunch with that guy. he is dads college friend. then we went to this alleyway with a lot of traditional chinese stuff like drawings, sculptures, and i ate a tang hulu. then we ate dinner with our dads brothers wife’s family. we saw jin dou and he smoked an e-cigarette. 

8/6
today we went to go see the aunts on my mothers side. we rode the subway for over an hour. their whole families came. I saw my cousins for the first time in a decade and they’re so big! Zhengyan is married and his wife came. They are both really cute, I hope their marriage is very successful. The wife is pregnant!
Wei Wei is still not married at like 30, and I understand why. I think I am a little mean for saying this but he is probably too focused on work, and doesn’t really take care of himself. I’m sure if he paid more attention to his looks he’d get a girlfriend easily! Because I think he is a nice guy. We ate a lot of good food. There was dried belt fish. I really liked the duck soup they made with the remainders of the peking duck. We went to sam’s club in the afternoon and brought back their version of the roasted chicken. The one in china is sweet and the one in the states is salty

8/7
I don’t really remember what we did this day but looking at my photos we made a pizza. Dada got sick.

8/8
My green warrior (hui li) shoes came! I really like them, they have little bears on them.
I also took the math placement for school. I placed into math 51 (yay) and I will have to take it next year or else I’d have to take the placement again. In the evening we followed dama to retrieve two packages. One was at the package distribution center in the enclosed wall of the neighborhood, and the other was at one outside the big wall. After that, she made us go back to the apartment and we stayed there while she went on her long walk.
