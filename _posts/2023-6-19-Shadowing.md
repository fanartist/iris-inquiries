I went to shadow Dr. Schott, who is the optometrist at Kindred Optics at 668 N Orlando Avenue, Maitland. 

I really do like the field. I think if I was subjected to going to a 9 to 5 that dealt with eyecare, I would be okay. You know when something just sounds bad? Like I know I wouldn't be able to stand going to a computer job, so I know I can't make that a career. Even art sounds dreary, I like it but not enough to decide to pursue it daily and as a method of income. 

At Dr. Schott's office, I followed him around as he went to take care of his patients. Contrary to what I thought when mom and I went to eye appointments, Dr. Schott was constantly going to appointments. It amazed me how large his social battery was, he also seemed to know all of the patients and remembered details about them. It seemed to me that I could say anything and Dr. Schott would know what I'm talking about, because he just is that sort of guy. He tries to know things so that he could talk to his patients more and get to know them. That's a skill I will do my best to develop as I go to college and go on my own path to becoming a eye care professional. 

On that day, of the patients we saw, many had Glucoma. That's when the inside of the eye produces too much fluid and causes the interior pressure to be too high. Left untreated for a long time, the axons in the eye are stressed and some die, leaving the patient with diminished vision. In some of the patients we saw, some lost their peripheral vision because of Glucoma. The treatment that Dr. Schott provides is teardrops that supposedly lower the pressure inside the eye (I'm not sure how it accomplishes that, but he says it does and I trust him). One father son duo both had glucoma but the father also lost the left side of his brain and couldn't see out of his right eye. The nerves to the eye cross or something, so one half of the brain deals with vision from the other side. And some other patients had cataracts. Dr. Schott doesn't deal with really specific stuff though I think, like if someone needs cataract surgery he only diagnoses it and refers them to someone else certified to do the surgery. That's another reason why my first choice would be to be an opthalmologist, and then an optometrist. 

He mentioned how if I went down the optometrist route, I should do residency. He did and he said it sets you ahead like 5 years. He said optometrists are better at diagnosing patients just because they get so much opportunity to come in contact with different people with different issues. 

I'm excited to go back on thursday!

A lady with some falling issues came as the first patient today, she also had some starting of cataracts.

Another lady we saw was one I saw when I came on monday! She had glucoma I think so the eye drops that Dr. Schott prescribed her were working. It was nice seeing her again. I think I understand how the doctor can care so much about each of his patients. He said he learned from another doctor that one shouldn't try to get new patients, one should try to make more friends out of the patients. When I go into the field, I really hope I can develop close bonds with each of the people I see, that they trust me with not only their eyes but other parts of their lives. Although I am not obligated to help them outside of the optical field since that is my job, I hope to not just know those people through a superficial job-oriented way but also as people. I understand it now when people say every person deserves to be treated as such. 

Revolution Health Record is the software he uses for his patients.

In the interior of the eye scans, a dense region of blue is the showtale sign of glucoma forming? - according to Dr. Schott. 

There was one patient that Dr. Schott 'advised' but in reality, seemed to say 'no' about me meeting her. Apparently this patient had a failed LASIK surgery and was sensitive about eye issues, so me being in the room would have made her quite uncomfortable. He didn't explicityly say this though, like I had to piece together myself what Dr. Schott was hinting at.

I don't know if you guys know, but the primary reason I ever wanted to become a doctor is because of you guys. I don't think I am scared of many things, but if i were to state something that causes a pit of despair it would be failing at something big, because that entails that I've failed you two. I never really show it but in this world, what I want most is for you two to be proud of me. 

Sorry I got caught up a little with all that sappy feelings stuff. I'm going to save that self-dialogue until the very last blog post before I go off to college.

Dr. Schott did show signs of stress to me when we went back to his office. He always talked to each of the patients in a really amiable manner, I would never had thought he was overwhelmed at all. That's something I have to learn as a doctor I guess, the skill of pretending to be friendly and amiable when really I probably don't want to talk to them. He did say that each patient is so complicated, like one lady fell into a knife or something as a child so her left eye's cornea is scarred over and cloudy. But her right eye is farsighted or something so it's just really complex to think about (supposedly) and hard to deal with it.

He also wouldn't let me be in the room with just the patient. I was very touched by that, because dr. schott said it was for MY safety. although I did suspect he didn't want me saying the wrong thing to the patients.

I had an overall great time shadowing. Thank you so much for getting the opportunity for me to confirm that this is the field I hope to dedicate my life to pursuing and helping others with their optical issues. From now on, I will get the opportunities by myself.
