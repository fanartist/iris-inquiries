For spring break this year we made our rounds to Naples, the Keys, Miami, and Jupiter. We went to see mom and dad's friends from OSU at Naples, rode on airboats, took a trolley through the everglades, and ate at numerous tasty restaurants. I'm being honest when I say I had a really great time with you guys. I didn't have the heart to say this to your guys' face but I am so dejected that this may be our last genuine spring break together. i get scared when I think of how I'll be in college, away from you guys, for a long period without obligations.

Thanks for a wonderful last spring break together. I promise I will come back often to see you guys when I am in college. I know I will be able to say my true feelings when the time comes for me to leave, but as of now, I am too embarrassed to tell you guys how much I will miss you all. 

On friday of that spring break, Johns Hopkins came back with a waitlist notification. I am pretty stoked that I even got waitlisted. I hope I get in! I probably won't go, but it would be incredibly validating if I did get in :) 
When you guys went to get costco pizza, I stayed home and made instant noodles and a salad. Please believe me when I say I will do my best to be healthy in college; please do not worry about me too much.

I love you all
Iris
