I didn't get into the UCF Burnett Medical Honors Program. This is the bachelor's-medical school joint program that we talked about a lot before. I'm sorry.

I did try pretty hard on the application. I know it's nothing that big of a deal and I thank you guys for being so understanding about it. When I saw the email from UCF bearing this news, I felt numb inside as I forwarded that email to you guys. I am so incredibly lucky to have as supportive parents as you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you for never making me academically stressed nor insecure about my self-worth.
When my friends talk about the academic expectations their parents place on them, I just can't relate. I had the privilege of having parents that were more accepting than usual. I think a big part of that is because we are of the Christian faith. 

Don't worry. If I only make one thing out of myself I'll be sure to fulfill our hopes. I will become a ophthalmologist.

I did get a Sia Yorker scholarship!! This is the scholarship that my dad had to pay like $30 dollars shipping money on, remember? I found out about it quite late, so I had to scramble to compile the necessary materials and write the essay in a three days.
On tuesday the week before, I kept on getting calls from this one specific number. I paid no attention to it and ignored it, because I was at school. Later that day, I recieved a text message from that same number about calling back because of a scholarship. Again, I was in school, so I thought about calling them back when I was off of school.
However, in my sixth period chemistry class, Mrs. Nikles recieved a call from the front desk. Turns out, Mrs. Yorker called my school as a last resort, because she couldn't get in touch with me! I then went up to the front desk to call back Mrs. Yorker and finalized the details about the banquet on saturday.
