Today was the first day I went to the UC wednesday nights.
I want to preface with the fact that I wasn't against the idea of volunteering at the church. I quite like the church, I think the community we are currently part of is one that is surprisingly accepting and open towards others. 

As you guys know, I did have a not-so-great encounter with a girl called Jenny from the wednesday night small groups. I think because of that, I was hesitant to really become involved at a deeper level with the church.

However, I like kids. And I really liked Wednesday nights, so much that I hope to continue to go every week until I have to leave for college.
